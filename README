Introduction
============

Mnemosyne is a simple blogging system which generates static files. You
provide it with some entries, which are stored in an ordinary Maildir, a
layout, which is a directory tree indicating where these entries should
go, and some styles, which are EmPy templates that the layout can use to
put pages together.

The layout tree may contain ordinary files, such as images, stylesheets,
or constant pages, and Python scripts, which will be used to generate
variable pages, XML feeds, or anything else you wish.

Requirements
============

* Python, probably at least version 2.2. I use 2.3.

* If you want to use reStructuredText to format entries as HTML,
  docutils. This is the default configuration, but you could also
  replace this with PyMarkdown, PyTextile, or nothing at all.

* EmPy, available at http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/empy/.

* Something that will allow you to create, add to and edit your Maildir.
  I use procmail and Mutt.

Configuration
=============

A Mnemosyne blog starts with a configuration file, which is a Python
script. The example provided in ``example/config.py`` explains what it
can do and what variables can be set. By default, Mnemosyne looks for
this file in ``~/Mnemosyne/config.py``.

Usage
=====

To regenerate your blog, simply run ``mnemosyne``, or, if your config
lives in a different location, ``mnemosyne path/to/config.py``. By
default, only pages for which the applicable entries or layout have been
changed since the page was last written will be evaluated; you can
override this and rebuild the entire blog with the ``--force`` option.
(At the moment, this is your only recourse if you change your styles.)

Layout
======

Layout scripts are also written in Python; any file with the executable
bit set will be executed to produce the corresponding output file. Apart
from any local variables defined in the blog's configuration, layouts
will be given the following:

* ``muse``: a ``mnemosyne.Muse`` object, the thing that generates the
  blog. It contains these attributes (among others, of course, but you
  can safely ignore the rest):

  - ``muse.entries``: the list of all entries in the blog.

  - ``muse.expand(style, locals)``: a callback function which opens an
    EmPy style and expands it with the provided local variables. In
    almost all cases, you'll use the builtin Python function
    ``locals()`` here.

* ``entries``: the subset of entries that apply to the particular file
  being generated. In an archive page, for example, this would be only
  the entries in that particular year, week, or whatever.

* ``write(s)``: Another callback function, which will take the provided
  data (a string) and actually write it out to the appropriate output
  file. Generally, this will be the last thing you call once you put the
  rest of the page together.

Files in the top level directory of your layout will be evaluated with
all the entries in the blog. However, you can create files or
directories with a name like ``__year__``, and it will produce files (or,
in this case, directories) named ``2006``, ``2007``, etc, which will be
evaluated in turn with only the entries for that year.

You can do the same thing for attributes which have multiple values, as
well: for example, a directory named ``__tags__`` will be evaluated for each
tag that appears on an entry, even if the tags are stored as a list. The
directory tree in ``examples/layout`` illustrates how to do each of
these, and a simple feed; you can of course be more creative.

Entries
=======

The values for all these expansions come from the attributes of
mnemosyne's Entry class. Several useful ones, such as ``subject`` and
``tags``, are provided by default: if you wish to define more, you may
add a mixin class to your configuration, with some specially-named
methods. Attributes may be calculated at initialization or only when
needed.

When generating file or directory names, the attributes' repr() is used,
so that dates, subject lines, and so on may be appropriately formatted
and linked to. The ``mnemosyne`` module provides the functions ``clean``
and ``magic``, to make creating useful values easier.

The default set of attributes are always encoded into your
configuration's character set before being sent to the layout. If you
define your own; take care not to send Unicode data to ``expand`` or
``write``, as they both must output a stream of bytes and won't
necessarily know the correct encoding to use. The best place to handle
this is probably in your configuration itself, unless you need to use
different encodings in different parts of your layout.

Styles
======

It would be tedious for layout scripts to generate an entire page by
themselves, so ``mnemosyne.Muse``'s ``expand`` method allows you to use
styles to do the hard work. Styles are EmPy templates, which are plain
text with embedded expressions, statements, control flow, etc. marked by
the '@' sign. Expressions in backticks are converted to text using
repr(); otherwise, they are converted with str(). A summary of all of
EmPy's features is beyond the scope of this document; you can follow
along with ``example/style`` to get an idea of the basics, or refer to
EmPy's documentation for a comprehensive explanation.

Entry Details
=============

For each entry ``e``, the following attributes (plus any you define) are
available:

* ``msg``: the message that the entry was created from. Initially, only
  the headers have been read; the rest is read when you access
  ``e.content``.

* ``date``: a time-tuple indicating the date on the Date: header.

* ``mtime``: a time-tuple indicating when the message's Maildir file was
  created. This is not the mtime of the file itself! Messing with
  Maildirs by hand is not recommended. To edit an entry, open the
  Maildir in mutt and hit the "e" key on its message.

* ``content``: the body of the entry, processed with reStructuredText.
  Its repr() is the first 100 characters of the unprocessed body
  (suitable for perhaps a summary feed).

* ``subject``: The contents of the Subject header. Its repr() is a
  URL-cleaned (at most 3 words) version of same, with a number appended
  to make each one unique within a given day: 'subject', 'subject-1',
  'subject-2', etc. These are calculated on startup in chronological
  order so that they are always the same.

* ``id``: The Message-Id: header. Its repr() is a tag: URL suitable for
  an Atom feed, as described in
  http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id.

* ``author``: Name from the From: header. Its repr() is the URL-cleaned
  version, in case you want to categorize a multi-author blog by author
  name.

* ``email``: Email address from the From: header. Its repr() is
  something like 'decklin at red dash bean dot com'.

* ``tags``: A list of the contents of the X-Tags: header, split by
  commas. URL-cleaned repr()s for tag categorization.

* ``year``, ``month``, ``day``: What the names imply. The values are
  ints; the repr()s are formatted with ``time.strftime``.

Updating
========

The ``contrib`` directory contains some small scripts to facilitate
updating your blog, and an example of how to put them together so that
your blog can pick up PGP-signed mail at a public email address (or
perhaps ordinary mail at an address internal to your own network) and
automatically rebuild itself upon receipt.

Future and Caveats
==================

I intend to write an SQLite backend once someone complains that it takes
too long to load their 10,000 entries. Be loquacious. At the moment,
however, Mnemosyne depends on the Maildir really being a Maildir (for
reliable modification times) and the standard ``email`` and ``mailbox``
modules, which are not perfect.

A lot of the more magic stuff may not be particularly good style; where
some clarity or brevity in Mnemosyne itself could be sacrificed to make
the layout and styles easier to work with, it has been.

About the Name
==============

Mnemosyne, in Greek mythology, is the personification of memory and
mother of the muses, goddesses whom poets would invoke to help them tell
a story. The metaphor, hopefully, should be obvious.
