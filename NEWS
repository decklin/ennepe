0.5 (2006-02-08):
=================

* Switch back to ``email`` for parsing messages, so we can support
  encoded messages (quoted-printable, charset RFC 2047 headers, whatever),
  and add a ``charset`` option in the configuration to specify the
  default encoding for data we send to the templates.

* Make ``mime-gpg-decode`` actually decode the message body in the same
  manner, rather than merely pulling the literal signed data out. This
  is not required, but is very convenient if you want to edit messages
  later. This also makes it congruous with ``mimedecode``, which you
  could use on unsigned mail.

* Renamed the EntryMixin interfaces to ``_prop_*`` and ``_init_*``, to
  better reflect what they really mean. In particular, ``_prop_*``
  attributes are now implemented as real properties. This means it is up
  to each method to decide when and how to cache property values.

0.4 (2006-02-04):
=================

* Added contrib directory with ``automnemosyne``, ``mime-gpg-decode``,
  and example procmail recipe.

* Don't copy ordinary files from layout unless they have been modified.
  Do update variable files if their layouts have been modified.

0.3 (2006-02-03):
=================

* Make the default Atom style mark content as HTML rather than XHTML
  (since the rest of the example layout is HTML).

0.2 (2006-02-03):
=================

* Add a --help option, better error messages, and more documentation.

0.1 (2006-02-02):
=================

* Initial release.
